This MATLAB code takes the number of input bits and generates binary sequences, encoding them by adjusting each value to avoid overflows and ensure proper bit length. It iterates through possible binary values, modifies them using custom logic to prevent data leakage, and displays the final encoded binary sequence. The encoding process handles edge cases like zero and maximum values to maintain data integrity.
